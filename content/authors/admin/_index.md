<p>
                                       I am a second year PhD student at School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University supervised by <a style="color: #5C33FF;" href="https://hunghtd.github.io/" target="https://hunghtd.github.io/"> <strong> Hung D. Nguyen </strong></a>.
										Before joining NTU, I worked with <a style="color: #5C33FF;" href="http://web.iitd.ac.in/~averma/" target="http://web.iitd.ac.in/~averma/"> <strong> Ashu Verma </strong> </a> for my M.Tech in Energy Studies at Centre for Energy Studies, Indian Institute of Technology Delhi (IITD).</p>                        
                        </p>
                        <p>           My research focus is on computational challenges in power system operation and control. 
										I am currently working on developing <strong> Explainable Machine Learning </strong> tools for power system analysis and operations.
										I am also focusing on devising novel methods to solve <strong> Small-Signal Stability Constraint Optimal Power Flow (SC-OPF) </strong> and other related problems efficiently in terms of computational cost and solution quality.
										I am keenly interested in learning and applying new mathematical tools to solve power system problems. </p>
